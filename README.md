# Power-BI-Sales-analysis
 Here I performed a sales analysis on data belonging to a sales company.The purpose of the analysis was to unlock sales insights that are not visible for the sales team for decision support. The End result is a dashboard providing quick and latest sales insights in order to support data driven decision making.
